# Fingertip-Drawboard

## A python3 project based on opencv.

- I comtemplated to recognize the pictures by CNN so it becomes a gesture recognizing project, but I even didn't had time to improve it.

- there are some lines should be modified if you want to use it

- if you run it know it will show you the porduce process
